Automatic Deployment:
If you want to set up automatic deployments on each push 
to your GitHub repository, you need to check your 
Vercel project settings:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard.
2. Find your project.
3. Navigate to the project settings.
Look for the "Deployments" or "Git" section.
Ensure that automatic deployments are configured.
If automatic deployments are already configured, 
any new push to the specified branch 
(in your case, the master branch) 
should trigger a new deployment.
